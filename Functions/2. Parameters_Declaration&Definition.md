# Parameters Declaration & Definition

- **Parameters** are the values that we pass into a function and the ability to pass these values into the function is called **Parameterizing the function**.
- For simple PowerShell functions, you do not have to pass any parameters as there is a default argument array that contains all the values passed to a function. 
  This default array is available in the automatic variable **$args**.
  
      PS> function hello { "Hello there $args, how are you?" }
      PS> hello Bob
      
      Output:
      ========
      Hello there Bob, how are you?
      
- There is one more automatic variable called **$OFS** which works as a separator for whatever is the value in **$args** variable.

      PS> function hello
      { $ofs=","
        "Hello there $args and how are you?"
      }
      PS> hello Bob Carol Ted Alice
      
      Output:
      =======
      Hello there Bob,Carol,Ted,Alice and how are you?
