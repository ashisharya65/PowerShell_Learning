# Parameters Declaration & Definition

- **Parameters** are the values that we pass into a function and the ability to pass these values into the function is called **Parameterizing the function**.
- For simple PowerShell functions, you do not have to pass any parameters as there is a default argument array that contains all the values passed to a function. 
  This default array is available in the variable **$args**.
