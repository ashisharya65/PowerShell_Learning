# Functions in PowerShell

- Functions are the most lightweight form of PowerShell command.
- They exist in memory only for the duration of a session. When you exit the session the functions are gone.

## Function Syntax

        function <name> {<statement list>}
    

* Here the statement list is also called **Script Block**.
